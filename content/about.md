Nice to meet you! 

As a research analyst at the [Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy](https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/center-nonprofits-and-philanthropy) at the [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/), my work investigates innovative approaches to equitable grantmaking strategies and practices. I contribute to the development of program evaluations and research products that evaluate inventive solutions to shift power within the philanthropic sector. 

By seeking out significant training and applying learned techniques, I am relied upon as the primary data analyst contrituting both quantitative and qualitative rigor to complex data analyses.  In addition to my strength in research analysis, I am viewed as an essential thought partner from designing and implementing federal program evaluations to writing RFPs that are centered in equitable grantmaking practices. 

To learn more about my work, read some of [my recent work](/posts/) or feel free to [reach out to me directly](/contact/).
